# Building Rotten Potatoes from Scratch

This is a demo of scaffolding the creation of Rotten Potatoes.

## Step 1: Make sure `rails` is installed

* We use `--minimal` to avoid setting up components we won't need.
* `--pretend` is a tool to _dry run_ so we can see what will happen before doing it.

```sh
rails -v
rails --help
rails new --help
rails new rottenpotatoes --pretend
rails new --minimal --skip-test rottenpotatoes
```

## Step 2: Make a Commit
```sh
git status
git add -A .
git commit -m 'Inital Commit'
```
## Step 3:
```
bin/rails server
```
## Step 4: Make a Movie Model

* We can make a bare model or scaffold one with a migration.
```sh
rails generate # also rails g
rails g --help
rails g scaffold movie -p
rails g scaffold --help
```


```sh
rails g scaffold movie \
  title:string \
  rating:string \
  release_date:date \
```

## Step 5 (Optional): Make the app look decent.

### https://github.com/rails/cssbundling-rails

This auto installs and sets up bootstrap.
There's not much exciting here, but it leverages tools to be productive.
```sh
bin/bundle add cssbundling-rails
bin/rails css:install:bootstrap
```

## Other Code Snippets:

### RAILS ROUTES

In `config/routes.rb`, use this if manually specifying resources.
```rb
get '/movies' => 'movies#index', as: 'movies'
get '/movies/new'=>'movies#new', as: 'new_movie'
post '/movies' => 'movies#create', as: 'create_movie'
get '/movies/:id' => 'movies#show', as: 'movie'
get '/movies/:id/edit' => 'movies#edit', as: 'edit_movie'
put '/movies/:id'=>'movies#update', as: 'update_movie'
delete '/movies/:id' => 'movies#destroy', as: 'delete_movie'

```


### Initial DB Migration

Use this if creating a new migration from scratch.
```rb
class CreateMovies < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
  def up
    create_table 'movies' do |t|
      t.string 'title'
      t.string 'rating'
      t.datetime 'release_date'
      # Add fields that let Rails automatically keep track
      # of when movies are added or modified:
      t.timestamps
    end
  end

  def down
    drop_table 'movies' # deletes the whole table and all its data!
  end
end
```
