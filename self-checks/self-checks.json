Similarly, when associations are used, << is redefined to \"fill in\" the foreign key on the newly-created owned object before it is added to the \"collection\" owned by the owning object. As an aside, note that in the third case, saving an owning object has the side effect of saving its owned objects---even if the owning object itself isn't changed by adding more owned objects to it (as is the case here)."
