Courseware for Engineering Software as a Service
================================================

a/k/a UC Berkeley CS 169 Software Engineering, a/k/a CS 169.1x/169.2x on
EdX

`vm-setup` contains install scripts designed to start from a clean
Ubuntu image (see comments inside script for which Ubuntu distro) and
install all the courseware needed for the class.

Version numbers in the VM names track the earliest version of the 
[book](http://saasbook.info) with which that VM image is designed to
work; using that VM with earlier-numbered versions of the book may not
give the results the book describes.

[Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) support files are also included
in case students want to try this automated build method.

`appspot` contains an AppEngine app deployed to saasbook.appspot.com.
Google graciously donates hosting for the VM image on a high-replication
AppEngine instance.  The app's README explains how to administer it and
upload new images there.

Added a new setup script for Ubuntu 12.04 and updated skeletons in new
folder hw-skeletons. Details in those folders. - Michael Smith
